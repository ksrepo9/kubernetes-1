# Kubernetes Volumes

Kubernetes volumes provide a way to manage and persist data in containerized applications. Hereâ€™s a concise overview:

## Types of Volumes

1. **Ephemeral Volumes**  
   Temporary storage tied to the pod lifecycle (e.g., `emptyDir`, `hostPath`).  

2. **Persistent Volumes (PV)**  
   Long-term storage independent of pod lifecycle, provisioned manually or dynamically.  

3. **Persistent Volume Claims (PVC)**  
   User requests for storage, binding to available PVs.  

4. **Storage Classes**  
   Define storage types (e.g., SSD, HDD) and provisioning behavior.  

5. **Volume Plugins**  
   Integrate with various storage systems like cloud providers (AWS EBS, Google Persistent Disk) or network storage (NFS).  

## Benefits  
- Data persistence  
- Scalability  
- Flexibility for stateful applications in Kubernetes
